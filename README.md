This is a probability based game. It uses an Mlab database to store the user's progress. This process runs on a set interval updating the user's progress every thirty seconds. Currently, there is no loading of this data upon logging into the game. Clicking on different star systems will travel to the selected system using the settings in the power controls. The smaller incraments of power per sub-system you use, the more efficient you are with your energy reserves. Certain variables determine the probability of events that can occur upon travel. These include finding resources in the form of credits if your sensors are high enough and repelling enemy attacks if your weapons and shields are high enough or outrunning enemy encounters if your engines are high enough.

load saved user variables to start where user last left off.
Upgrade sub-systems
Buy sell and trade cargo
High score system
Random galaxy generation
More customizeable ship, scout, cruiser dreadnaught
